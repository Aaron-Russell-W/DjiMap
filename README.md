# DjiMap
A Djikstra's Algorithm approach to a route finder, using system set points for landmarks around Waterford. The user can select
any points on the map and the system will generate the shortest path between them. The user can also set points for the route finder to avoid ensuring they dont pass the set landmark.


### Things to do
```
Refine GUI it is fine in current capacity but could be better.
Implement a preferred route option allowing users to set points they wish to pass on the way to the destination
